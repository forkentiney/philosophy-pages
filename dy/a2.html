<dt><b><a name="aes">aesthetics</a></b>
<dd><p>Branch of philosophy that studies <a href="b2.html#beauty">beauty</a> and taste, including their specific manifestations in the tragic, the comic, and the <a href="s9.html#subl">sublime</a>.
Its central issues include questions about the origin and status of aesthetic judgments:
are they <a href="o.html#obje">objective</a> statements about genuine features of the world or purely <a href="s9.html#subj">subjective</a> expressions of personal attitudes;
should they include any reference to the <a href="i9.html#inty">intentions</a> of artists or the reactions of patrons; and
how are they related to judgments of <a href="m9.html#moral">moral</a> value?
More specifically, aesthetics considers each of these issues as they arise for various arts, including architecture, painting, sculpture, music, dance, theatre, and literature.
Aesthetics is a significant component of the philosophical work of
<a href="../ph/plat.html"><em>Plato</em></a>,
<a href="../ph/aris.html"><em>Aristotle</em></a>,
<a href="../ph/kant.html"><em>Kant</em></a>, and
<a href="s.html#sant">Santayana</a>.

<p>Example: <em>"All senators are eligible to vote on legislation, but no homeless people are senators, so all homeless people are eligible to vote on legislation."</em>
<p>The problem with any such reasoning is that the exclusion of one class from another cannot provide deductively certain grounds for the inclusion of either of these classes with another.

<p>Examples: <em>"All spaniels are dogs."</em> and <em>"Some children are people who play word games."</em>
<p>The first affirms that every spaniel also belongs to the class of dogs, while the latter affirms that there is at least one member commonly included among both children and people who play word games.

Alexander defended <a href="r.html#reamp">perceptual realism</a> as an alternative to the

His theory regarding the "emergent evolution" of
<a href="m7.html#mind">mind</a> within the natural order, proposed in
<cite>Space, Time, and Deity</cite> (1920), was similar in many respects to the views of

Alexander also developed a thorough
<a href="a9.html#axgy">axiology</a> in
<cite>Beauty and other Forms of Value</cite> (1933) .
During his tenure at Manchester, Alexander helped Zionist colleague Chaim Weizmann secure the Balfour agreement, an initial step toward creation of the modern state of Israel.

According to Althusser, social organization is determined wholly by ideological consequences expressed in economic and political power, enforced in home and family as well as in the workplace. The differential roles to which individuals are assigned in a society, he argued, are clearly signified not only by the presence of particular notions in its cultural
