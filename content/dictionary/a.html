<dd><p>French scholastic logician whose sexual relationship with his teen-aged student H&eacute;lo&iuml;se provoked the vengeful anger of her uncle, Fulbert, in 1118.
Despite the many distractions of the turbulent personal life he described in
<cite><a target="new" href="http://www.georgetown.edu/irvinemj/classics203/texts/historia.html">Historia Calamitatum Mearum</a>
(<a target="new" href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/abelard-histcal.html">The History of my Misfortunes</a>)</cite>,
Abelard embarked on a monastic career of detached contemplation marked by intellectual independence from both traditional authorities and contemporaneous fashions.
In commentaries on the logic of
<a href="../ph/aris.html"><em>Aristotle</em></a> and his own <cite>Dialectica</cite>, Abelard invented a novel solution to the problem of
<a href="u.html#uni">universals</a> that rejected both
<a href="r.html#ream">realism</a> and
<a href="n9.html#nomi">nominalism</a> in their most extreme forms.
Only individual things exist for Abelard, but
<a href="../hy/3f.html#abelard">general terms have universal applicability</a> to things whose common features are known by a process of
<a href="a.html#abst">mental abstraction</a>.
In his <cite>Scito te Ipsum</cite> (<cite>Know Thyself</cite>)
 Abelard defended a theological 
<a href="e9.html#eth">ethics</a> according to which only the <a href="i9.html#inty">intention</a> of respecting the good&#0151;rather than actions or their consequences&#0151;is morally valuable.
Abelard also wrote on the difficulties involved in scriptural interpretation in <cite>Sic et Non</cite> (<cite>For and Against</cite>) (1122).

<dd><p>The process of forming a general <a href="c7.html#cpt">concept</a> by omitting every distinguishing feature from our notions of some collection of particular things; thus, substantively, an abstraction is the concept or idea that results from this process.
Introduced by <a href="a.html#abelard">Peter Abelard</a> as part of his solution to the
<a href="u.html#uni">problem of universals</a>, abstraction became crucial for other
<a href="n9.html#nomi">nominalistic</a> explanations, including
<a href="../ph/lock.html"><em>Locke</em></a>'s account of our use of general terms.
Thus, for example, the idea of "green" could in principle be derived by abstracting from one's specific experiences of a summer lawn, the leaves of trees, and emeralds.
<a href="../ph/berk.html"><em>Berkeley</em></a>, on the other hand, argued that
<a href="../hy/4r.html">abstract ideas in this sense are impossible</a> because every sensible idea has only particular content.
In the more recent work of <a href="f9.html#freg">Frege</a>, <a href="../ph/quin.html"><em>Quine</em></a>, and <a href="k9.html#krip">Kripke</a>, efforts to understand the status of abstract ideas focus on the proper

Act-utilitarianism supposes that each particular action should be evaluated solely by reference to the merit of its own consequences,

<p>The rule-utilitarian asks, <em>"How much pleasure or pain would result if everyone were to do this?"</em><br><br>

(<a target="new" href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/at/adler.htm">What Life Should Mean to You</a>)</cite> (1934) .
Influenced by the philosophy of <a href="v.html#vaih">Hans Vaihinger</a>, Adler's "individual psychology" focussed on the efforts people invariably make in order to compensate for their (self-perceived) inferiority to others, whether it originally arose from a specific physical defect, relative position in the family constellation, particular experiences of humiliation, or a general lack of social feeling (<i>Gemeinschaftsgef&uuml;hl</i>) for others. Adlerian theory and practice have proven especially productive in application to the lives of children.

<dd><p>German musicologist, social critic, and political philosopher; author of
<cite>Philosophie der neuen Musik</cite> (<cite>The Philosophy of Modern Music</cite>) (1949) and <cite>Noten zur Literatur</cite> (<cite>Notes to Literature</cite>) (1958-74).
A leading member of the
<a href="f9.html#fran">Frankfurt school</a>, Adorno traced the development and failure of Western reliance on <a href="r.html#reas">reason</a> in his
<cite>Dialektik der Aufkl&auml;rung
(<a target="new" href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/adorno.htm">Dialectic of Enlightenment</a>)</cite> (1947) .
The abstract concepts of rationality, he argued, separate individual human beings from their sensuous nature as knowing subjects.
<cite>Negative Dialektik</cite> (<cite>Negative Dialectics</cite>) (1966) openly defends the critical task of exposing, dissolving, and undermining the harmful influence of rigid conceptual schemes.
In <cite>The Authoritarian Personality</cite> (1951) Adorno described the ways conformity to the demands of social propriety imposes paradox and contradiction on the lives of individual human beings.
